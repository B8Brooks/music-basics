      <p>
        <strong>Harmony</strong> is what happens when two or more notes sound{" "}
        <strong>at the same time</strong>. The most common building block is a{" "}
        <strong>chord</strong> — usually three notes played together. Chords
        are like the cushion the melody sits on: play the same melody over
        different chords and it can feel happy, sad, or tense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quick rule of thumb: <strong>melody = one note after another</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>harmony = notes stacked on top of each other</strong>.
