      <p>
        The <strong>beat</strong> is the steady, evenly-spaced pulse you nod
        your head or tap your foot to. It usually repeats in groups of{" "}
        <strong>4</strong> — musicians count <em>“1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4…”</em>{" "}
        over and over. Beat 1 (the <strong>downbeat</strong>) feels the
        strongest, like the start of each little cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        How fast the beat goes is the <strong>tempo</strong>, measured in{" "}
        <strong>BPM</strong> (beats per minute). 60 BPM is one beat every
        second — a slow ballad. 120+ BPM gets people dancing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Your resting heart beats at roughly
        60–100 BPM — the same range as most songs. That&apos;s part of why slow
        songs feel calm (slower than your heart) and fast songs feel exciting
        (faster than your heart). Music literally plays with your pulse!
